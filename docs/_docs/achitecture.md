# Architecture

ZIO Magnum is designed with a modular architecture that emphasizes separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.

* [ZIO](https://zio.dev) is a powerful library for asynchronous and concurrent programming in Scala, providing a functional programming model that simplifies error handling and resource management. 
* ’[Magnum](https://github.com/AugustNagro/magnum) is a type-safe, compile-time verified SQL query builder and database access library for Scala, designed to work seamlessly with ZIO.

ZIO magnum relies both on ZIO and Magnum to provide a robust and scalable solution for database access in Scala applications.

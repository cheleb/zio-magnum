## Magnum ZIO integration.

This project provides a [ZIO](https://zio.dev/) integration for [Magnum](https://github.com/AugustNagro/magnum), a [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) 3 library for building type-safe, composable, and extensible applications.
It allows you to use Magnum's features in a ZIO environment, enabling you to build applications with ZIO's powerful concurrency and resource management capabilities.


This is POC intented to be merged into the main Magnum repository once it is stable and functional.

In the meanwhile, it serves as a standalone project to demonstrate the integration and gather feedback from the community.

See [ZIO Magnum documentation](https://cheleb.github.io/zio-magnum/docs/index.html) for more information about the integration and how to use it.



See the [Magnum documentation](https://augustnagro.github.io/magnum/) for more information about Magnum.

For the very impatient, you can quickly generate a new ZIO Magnum project using the following command:

```bash
sbt new cheleb/zio-magnum.g8
```

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
